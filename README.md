# Flowing Concrete
Concrete that hardens over time. Cheap alternative to lava cooling. Flowing concrete become full blocks by default, or slabs if enabled.

Concrete block and wet cement textures taken from basic_materials by mt-mods. Bucket texture is an altered version of the milk bucket from Animalia by ElCeejo.
